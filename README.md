# Numerical-Analysis
This repository contains Python implementations of various numerical analysis methods that I've studied. It serves as a collection of algorithms and techniques from the field of numerical mathematics, aimed at solving a wide range of mathematical problems. The repository includes methods for:

Newton Interpolation(with polynomial generation and point approximation) 
Lagrange Interpolation(with polynomial generation and point approximation) 
And more to be added alongthe way

Each method is implemented in Python and includes explanations, examples, and sometimes visualizations to help understand the concepts. The goal of this project is both to reinforce my understanding of numerical analysis and to provide a useful resource for others interested in these methods.

Feel free to explore, use, and contribute to the repository!
